        "abstract": "Success of invasive non-native plant species management is usually
        measured as changes in the abundance of the invasive plant species or native
        plant species following invader management, but more complex trophic responses
        to invader removal are often ignored or assumed. Moreover, the effects of
        invader removal at different stages of the invasion process is rarely evaluated,
        despite a growing recognition that invader impacts are density or stage-dependent.
        Therefore, the effectiveness of invasive species management for restoring
        community structure and function across trophic levels remains poorly understood.
        We determined how soil nematode diversity and community composition respond
        to removal of the globally invasive tree species Pinus contorta at different
        stages of invasion by reanalysing and expanding an earlier study including
        uninvaded vegetation (seedlings removed continuously), early invader removal
        (saplings removed), late removal (trees removed), and no removal (invaded).
        These treatments allowed us to evaluate the stage-dependent belowground trophic
        responses to biological invasion and removal. We found that invaded plots
        had half the nematode taxa richness compared to uninvaded plots, and that
        tree invasion altered the overall composition of the nematode community. Differences
        in nematode community composition between uninvaded nematode communities and
        those under the tree removal strategy tended to dilute higher up the food
        chain, whereas the composition of uninvaded vs. sapling removal strategies
        did not differ significantly. Conversely, the composition of invaded compared
        to uninvaded nematode communities differed across all trophic levels, altering
        the community structure and function. Specifically, invaded communities were
        structurally simplified compared to uninvaded communities, and had a higher
        proportion of short life cycle nematodes, characteristic of disturbed environments.
        We demonstrate that a shift in management strategies for a globally invasive
        tree species from removing trees to earlier removal of saplings is needed
        for maintaining the composition and structure of soil nematode communities
        to resemble uninvaded conditions.", "title": "Community- and trophic-level

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Biomass maps are valuable tools for estimating
        forest carbon and forest planning. Individual-tree biomass estimates made
        using allometric equations are the foundation for these maps, yet the potentially-high
        uncertainty and bias associated with individual-tree estimates is commonly
        ignored in biomass map error. We developed allometric equations for lodgepole
        pine (Pinus contorta), ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
        menziesii) in northern Colorado. Plot-level biomass estimates were combined
        with Landsat imagery and geomorphometric and climate layers to map aboveground
        tree biomass. We compared biomass estimates for individual trees, plots, and
        at the landscape-scale using our locally-developed allometric equations, nationwide
        equations applied across the U.S., and the Forest Inventory and Analysis Component
        Ratio Method (FIA-CRM). Total biomass map uncertainty was calculated by propagating
        errors from allometric equations and remote sensing model predictions. Two
        evaluation methods for the allometric equations were compared in the error
        propagation\u2014errors calculated from the equation fit (equation-derived)
        and errors from an independent dataset of destructively-sampled trees (n\u2009=\u2009285).
        Results Tree-scale error and bias of allometric equations varied dramatically
        between species, but local equations were generally most accurate. Depending
        on allometric equation and evaluation method, allometric uncertainty contributed
        30\u201375% of total uncertainty, while remote sensing model prediction uncertainty
        contributed 25\u201370%. When using equation-derived allometric error, local
        equations had the lowest total uncertainty (root mean square error percent
        of the mean [% RMSE]\u2009=\u200950%). This is likely due to low-sample size
        (10\u201320 trees sampled per species) allometric equations and evaluation
        not representing true variability in tree growth forms. When independently
        evaluated, allometric uncertainty outsized remote sensing model prediction
        uncertainty. Biomass across the 1.56 million ha study area and uncertainties
        were similar for local (2.1 billion Mg;\u00a0% RMSE\u2009=\u200997%) and nationwide
        (2.2 billion Mg; \u00a0% RMSE\u2009=\u200994%) equations, while FIA-CRM estimates
        were lower and more uncertain (1.5 billion Mg; \u00a0% RMSE\u2009=\u2009165%).
        Conclusions Allometric equations should be selected carefully since they drive
        substantial differences in bias and uncertainty. Biomass quantification efforts
        should consider contributions of allometric uncertainty to total uncertainty,
        at a minimum, and independently evaluate allometric equations when suitable
        data are available.", "title": "Variability and uncertainty in forest biomass

        of these fuel treatments is to inhibit the development of fast-spreading,
        high-intensity crown fires that naturally occur in boreal forest ecosystems.
        We document fuel treatment design standards used in boreal forests in Canada
        and review data requirements and methodological approaches for investigating
        fuel treatment effects on fire behaviour. Through a series of illustrative
        examples and summaries of empirical observations, we explore the implications
        of data and modelling assumptions used to estimate fire behaviour in fuel-treated
        areas and identify insights about fuel treatment effectiveness in boreal conifer
        stands. Fuel treatments in black spruce, jack pine and lodgepole pine stands
        were generally effective at reducing modelled and observed fire behaviour
        and inhibiting crown fire development and spread under low to moderate fire
        weather conditions. Evidence suggests that fuel treatments in these fuel types
        will be ineffective when rates of spread and wind speeds are very high or
        extreme. High surface fuel loads combined with the relatively short stature
        of boreal conifer trees can further undermine fuel treatment efforts. Priority
        areas for future study include examining alternatives for managing surface
        fuel loads in treated stands, exploring the viability of alternative horizontal
        fuel reduction protocols such as clumped fuel configurations, and integrating
        suppression and containment strategies within the fuel treatment planning
        and design process.", "title": "Stand-Level Fuel Reduction Treatments and

        "Research Highlights: Atypical and poorly understood attacks by <i>Dendroctonus
        rufipennis</i> (Kirby) to <i>Pinus contorta</i> Doug. ex Loudon were detected
        in the southern Rocky Mountains (SRM). The phenomenon is confirmed across
        all examined area. Its reproduction is described for the first time as well
        as the first attacks of <i>D. adjunctus</i> Blandf. in that host. Improved
        detection and diagnostics of <i>D. rufipennis</i> will allow a simpler, and
        efficient identification of the species. It will improve the detection capacity
        by pest detection specialists and entomologists, which will increase our understanding
        of the phenomena within and beyond the known range. Background and Objectives:
        In addition to <i>D. ponderosae</i> Hopk. other <i>Dendroctonus</i> species,
        sometimes together, attacked <i>P. contorta</i> that grew intermixed with
        <i>Picea engelmannii</i> in the SRM\u2019 subalpine forest. The identification
        of these beetles was difficult. The goal was to improve the detection and
        identification of the species from similar <i>Dendroctonus</i> spp. attacking
        that host and to uncover biological facts about the phenomena. Materials and
        Methods: <i>Dendroctonus</i> attacking <i>P. contorta</i> were collected along
        the entire SRM, their attack signs and behavior were recorded. These characteristics
        were revised from those in the literature and new characters were introduced
        and tested. Results: The identification of <i>Dendroctonus</i> bark beetles
        attacking <i>P. contorta</i> in the SRM was improved using revised and new
        characters including attack signs, attack behavior, and adult beetle characters.
        An improved identification key couplet is presented to effectively distinguish
        <i>D. murrayanae</i> from <i>D. rufipennis</i>. Conclusions: Simplified insect
        identifications that are both accessible to users with different levels of
        expertise and are based on insect characters, their attack pattern, and signs,
        like the present, improve detection of insects of interest. Efficient insect
        detections allow a better understanding of the capabilities they have and
        the impact they cause to the woodland ecosystems we study, protect, and manage
        around the globe.", "title": "Improved Identification and New Records of <i>Dendroctonus</i>

        "abstract": "Abstract Understanding drivers of disturbances across scales
        is critical as environmental constraints change in a warming climate. Outbreaks
        of native bark beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) are key natural disturbances
        that shape the structure and function of conifer forests across the northern
        hemisphere. While drivers of bark beetle outbreaks have been studied extensively
        at spatial scales ranging from stands to continents, within\u2010stand processes
        governing individual tree mortality in an outbreak are less well understood.
        Here, we use a spatially explicit long\u2010term monitoring dataset of a lodgepole
        pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forest (>9000 individually mapped trees
        in three 2\u2010ha plots) impacted by a severe mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus
        ponderosae) outbreak to explore interactions among fine scale drivers of beetle\u2010caused
        tree mortality. Using a Bayesian spatial modeling approach, we evaluated how
        tree scale and tree neighborhood scale characteristics interact with tree
        size to mediate host tree susceptibility to mountain pine beetle outbreak
        in the Southern Rocky Mountains (USA). We found evidence that both tree growth
        rate preceding the outbreak and neighborhood structure (within a 10 meter
        radius of the host tree) mediate the effect of tree size, and that the direction
        and magnitude of these mediating effects vary with tree size. Tree scale mortality
        probability increased with pre\u2010outbreak growth rate for small to medium
        sized host trees (~10\u201325\u00a0cm diameter), but that same effect was
        not detected for large trees. Conversely, tree scale mortality probability
        increased with greater neighborhood density, with the most pronounced effects
        for medium to large sized host trees (~15\u201330\u00a0cm diameter). Within\u2010stand
        topographic variability was not an important predictor of mortality probability;
        among stands, however, the stand in the driest topographic position experienced
        the greatest overall mortality. By explicitly considering how within\u2010stand
        heterogeneity mediates individual tree scale susceptibility to bark beetle
        outbreak, our findings bridge an important gap in understanding multi\u2010scale
        drivers of disturbance dynamics.", "title": "Neighborhood context mediates

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Water-use efficiency (WUE) represents the
        coupling of forest carbon and water. Little is known about the responses of
        WUE to thinning at multiple spatial scales. The objective of this research
        was to use field measurements to understand short-term effects of two thinning
        treatments (T1: 4500 stems ha\u22121; and T2: 1100 stems ha\u22121) and the
        control (NT: 27,000 stems ha\u22121) on WUE at the three spatial scales (leaf
        level: the ratio of leaf photosynthesis to leaf transpiration; tree-level:
        tree growth to tree transpiration; and stand level: net primary production
        (NPP) to stand transpiration) and intrinsic WUEi (the ratio of leaf photosynthesis
        to stomatal conductance at leaf-level; and NPP to canopy conductance at stand-level)
        in a 16-year old natural lodgepole pine forest. Leaf-level measurements were
        conducted in 2017, while tree- and stand-level measurements were conducted
        in both 2016 (the normal precipitation year) and 2017 (the drought year).
        Results The thinning treatments did not significantly affect the tree- and
        stand-level WUE in the normal year of 2016. However, the thinning significantly
        affected WUE in the drought year of 2017: T2 exhibited significantly higher
        tree-level WUE (0.49\u00a0mm2\u00a0kg\u22121) than NT\u00a0(0.08\u00a0mm2\u00a0kg\u22121),
        and compared to NT, the stand-level WUE values in the thinned stands (T1 and
        T2) were significantly higher, with means of\u00a00.31, 0.56 and 0.70\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22123,
        respectively. However, the leaf-level and stand-level WUEi in the thinned
        stands in the drought year were significantly lower than those in the unthinned
        stands. No significant differences in the leaf-level WUE were found among
        the treatments in 2017. In addition, the thinning\u00a0did not significantly
        change the WUE-VPD relationships at any studied spatial scale. Conclusions
        The thinning treatments did not cause significant changes in all studied WUE
        metrics in a normal year. However, their effects were significantly promoted
        under the drought conditions probably due to the decrease in soil water availability,
        demonstrating that thinning can improve WUE and consequently support forests
        to cope with the drought effects. The inconsistent results on the effects
        of the thinning on forest carbon and water coupling at the spatial scales
        and the lack of the consistent WUE metrics constraint across-scale comparison

        Serotiny, the retention of seeds in a canopy seed bank until high temperatures
        cause seeds to be released, is an important life history trait for many woody
        plants in fire\u2010prone habitats. Serotiny provides a competitive advantage
        after fire but increases vulnerability to predispersal seed predation, due
        to the seeds being retained in clusters in predictable locations for extended
        periods. This creates opposing selection pressures. Serotiny is favored in
        areas of high fire frequency, but is selected against by predispersal seed
        predators. However, predation also selects for cone traits associated with
        seed defense that could reduce predation on serotinous cones and thereby relax
        selection against serotiny. This helps explain the elevated defenses in highly
        serotinous species. However, whether such interactions drive variation in
        seed defenses within variably serotinous populations has been studied rarely.
        We investigated the effects of phenotypic selection exerted by red squirrel
        (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) predation on Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus
        contorta latifolia) seeds. Squirrels preferentially harvested cones with more
        and larger seeds, indicating a preference for a higher food reward. We found
        evidence for stronger selection on trees with serotinous cones, which presumably
        accounts for the elevated defenses of and lower predation on serotinous compared
        to non\u2010serotinous cones. Lower levels of predation on serotinous cones
        in turn lessen selection against serotiny by squirrels. This has important
        implications because the frequency of serotiny in lodgepole pine has profound
        consequences for post\u2010fire communities and ecosystems widespread in the
        Rocky Mountains.", "title": "Enhanced seed defenses potentially relax selection

        practices such as pre-commercial thinning (PCT) and repeated fertilization
        have been used successfully around the world to increase forest biomass for
        conventional wood products, biofuels, and carbon sequestration. Two complementary
        studies were designed to test the hypotheses (H) that large-scale PCT and
        PCT with repeated fertilization of young (13&#8722;17 years old) lodgepole
        pine (<i>Pinus contorta</i> var. <i>latifolia</i>) stands, at 25 years after
        the onset of treatments, would enhance (H<sub>1</sub>) productivity and structural
        features (diameter and height growth, crown volume and dimensions) of crop
        trees; (H<sub>2</sub>) merchantable volume of crop trees, (H<sub>3</sub>)
        abundance of understory conifer, herb and shrub layers, and (H<sub>4</sub>)
        carbon storage (sequestration) of all layers. Results are from two studies
        in south-central British Columbia, Canada. The PCT study had three densities:
        500, 1000, and 2000 stems/ha, an unthinned, and old-growth stand replicated
        at three areas. The PCT-FERT study had four densities: 250, 500, 1000, and
        2000 stems/ha with and without a repeated fertilization treatment, and an
        unthinned-unfertilized stand, replicated at two areas. Heavily thinned (&#8804;1000
        stems/ha) and fertilized stands generally had larger mean diameters and crown
        dimensions than lightly thinned or unfertilized stands, whereas mean heights
        of crop trees remained relatively unaffected, and hence partial support for
        H<sub>1</sub>. Despite differences in stand density (4- and 8-fold) of original
        crop trees, ingress of intermediate crop trees over the 25 years changed density
        dramatically. There was no support for H<sub>2</sub>, as mean merchantable
        volume of total crop trees was similar across stand densities owing to ingress,
        and was also similar in fertilized and unfertilized stands. In stands thinned
        to &#8804;500 trees/ha, there is an anticipated increase in crop tree density
        of 2.2 to 4.3 times over 25 years compared with the original post-thinning
        densities. Mean abundance of understory conifers was generally similar among
        stands owing to successional development towards canopy closure, whereas herbs
        and shrubs persisted only in canopy gaps in heavily thinned stands, thereby
        providing no support for H<sub>3</sub>. Mean carbon storage was similar across
        densities in both studies with ingress contributing a considerable amount
        to carbon sequestration at the lower densities. Fertilization increased (1.4
        times) mean carbon storage significantly among total crop trees, total conifers,
        and the grand total of all layers, thereby providing partial support for H<sub>4</sub>.
        Thus, much of the potential above-ground carbon storage lost by thinning was
        restored in the heavily thinned stands at 25 years post-treatment.", "title":

        "<i>Research Highlights:</i> I sought to disentangle the influences of tree
        age, growth rate, and dwarf mistletoe infection on resin duct defenses in
        lodgepole pine, <i>Pinus contorta</i> Douglas ex Loudon, revealing the presence
        of direct positive and indirect negative effects of mistletoe on defenses.
        <i>Background and Objectives:</i> For protection against natural enemies,
        pines produce and store oleoresin (resin) in &#8216;resin ducts&#8217; that
        occur throughout the tree. Dwarf mistletoe, <i>Arceuthobium americanum</i>
        Nutt. ex Engelm. (hereafter &#8220;mistletoe&#8221;), is a widespread parasitic
        plant affecting the pines of western North America. Infection by mistletoe
        can suppress pine growth and increase the probability of insect attack&#8212;possibly
        due to a reduction in resin duct defenses or in the potency of chemical defenses
        at higher levels of mistletoe infection, as reported in <i>Pinus banksiana</i>
        Lamb. However, the influence of mistletoe infection on defenses in other pine
        species remains unclear. I hypothesized that mistletoe infection would induce
        greater resin duct defenses in <i>P. contorta</i> while simultaneously suppressing
        annual growth, which was expected to reduce defenses. <i>Materials and Methods:</i>
        Using increment cores from <i>P. contorta</i> trees occurring in a subalpine
        forest of Colorado, USA, I quantified tree age, annual growth, annual resin
        duct production (#/annual ring), and cross-sectional area (mm<sup>2</sup>
        of resin ducts/annual ring). <i>Results:</i> Mistletoe infection increased
        with tree age and had a direct positive relationship with resin duct defenses.
        However, mistletoe infection also had an indirect negative influence on defenses
        via the suppression of annual growth. <i>Conclusions:</i> Through the combined
        direct and indirect effects, mistletoe infection had a net positive impact
        on resin duct production but a net negative impact on the total resin duct
        area. This finding highlights the complexity of pine defense responses to
        natural enemies and that future work is needed to understand how these responses
        influence overall levels of resistance and the risk of mortality.", "title":

        plant communities, including plant invasions. This is conditioned by plant
        palatability which can be reduced by its chemical or physical traits. The
        effects that ungulates browsing has on pine invasions are variable and the
        empirical evidence on the causes of this variability is scarce. We experimentally
        explored how sheep browsing preference varies between seedlings of pine species
        with different invasiveness; Pinus contorta (high invasiveness), P. ponderosa
        (medium invasiveness), P. radiata (medium invasiveness) and P. jeffreyi (low
        invasiveness). Secondly, we quantified anti-herbivory chemical compounds and
        physical traits of these species and related them with sheep preference observed.
        The browsing incidence of P. contorta was 68%, P. ponderosa 58%, P. radiata
        29%, and P. jeffreyi 84%. Among anti-herbivory traits analyzed, \u03b1-pinene
        concentration had a negative effect on the probability of a terminal bud being
        browsed and on browsing intensity. Meanwhile, foliar toughness was negatively
        related to browsing intensity and water concentration was positively related
        to browsing intensity. Also, the most invasive species, P. contorta, was highly
        damaged. Thus, sheep herbivory could be slowing pine invasion rate; suggesting
        that could be considered a tool to control early invasions, especially for
        this particular species.", "title": "Sheep feeding preference as a tool to

        the most common regeneration method is planting after clearcutting and, often,

        quantitative effects that have been reported for the five main MSP methods
        in terms of survival and growth of manually planted coniferous seedlings of
        Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)
        and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm.) in clearcuts in
        these three countries. Meta analyses are used to compare the effects of MSP
        methods to control areas where there was no MSP and identify any relationships
        with temperature sum and number of years after planting. In addition, the
        area of disturbed soil surface and the emergence of naturally regenerated
        seedlings are evaluated. The MSP methods considered are patch scarification,
        disc trenching, mounding, soil inversion and ploughing. Studies performed
        at sites with predominately mineral soils (with an organic topsoil no thicker
        than 0.30 m), in boreal, nemo-boreal and nemoral vegetation zones in the three
        Fenno-Scandinavian countries are included in the review. Data from 26 experimental
        and five survey studies in total were compiled and evaluated. The results
        show that survival rates of planted conifers at sites where seedlings are
        not strongly affected by pine weevil (Hylobius abietis L.) are generally 80\u201390%
        after MSP, and 15\u201320 percent units higher than after planting in non-prepared
        sites. The experimental data indicated that soil inversion and potentially
        ploughing (few studies) give marginally greater rates than the other methods
        in this respect. The effects of MSP on survival seem to be independent of
        the temperature sum. Below 800 degree days, however, the reported survival
        rates are more variable. MSP generally results in trees 10\u201325% taller
        10\u201315 years after planting compared to no MSP. The strength of the growth
        effect appears to be inversely related to the temperature sum. The compiled
        data may assist in the design, evaluation and comparison of possible regeneration

        evaluates the hydrologic response of restoration of a montane meadow by removal
        of encroached <i>Pinus contorta</i> and thinning of the adjacent forest. It
        is now a follow-up with four years of post-restoration data, on a previous
        analysis of a hydrologic response of the same meadow one year following restoration.
        A hydrologic change was evaluated through a statistical comparison of soil
        moisture and depth to groundwater between the restored Marian Meadow and a
        Control Meadow. Meadow water budgets and durations of water table depths during
        the growing season were evaluated. The four years following restoration of
        Marian Meadow had an increase in volumetric soil moisture during the wet season,
        but decreased soil moisture during the dry season. An average decrease in
        depth to groundwater of 0.15 m was found, which is consistent with the first-year
        post-restoration. The water budget confirms the first-year results that the
        hydrologic change following removal of encroached conifers was primarily due
        to a reduction of vegetation interception capture. There was no measurable
        difference in depth to groundwater or soil moisture following the upslope
        forest thinning likely due to the low level of forest removal with 2.8 m<sup>2</sup>/hectare
        reduction of the forest basal area. The cost of restoration to water gained
        was $0.69 USD/1000 L ($2.62 USD/1000 gal.).", "title": "Hydrologic Response

        "abstract": "<i>Research Highlights:</i> We investigated the competitive interactions
        among three tree species (interior Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>
        var. <i>glauca</i> (Beissn.) Franco), interior spruce (<i>Picea glauca</i>
        [Moench] Voss &#215; <i>Picea engelmannii</i> Engelm.), and lodgepole pine
        (<i>Pinus contorta</i> Dougl. Ex Loud. var. <i>latifolia</i> Englem.)) in
        multi-aged stands in central British Columbia, Canada. <i>Background and Objectives:</i>
        Understanding competitive interactions among tree species in mixed-species
        stands is fundamental to supporting silvicultural decision-making in such
        stands. Using the periodic annual basal area increment for single trees as
        our dependent variable, we investigated whether neighboring trees competed
        with subject trees independently of species identity. We also examined the
        differences in single-tree basal area growth among the three conifer species
        over time under different levels of competition. <i>Materials and Methods:</i>
        We developed several spatially explicit, single-tree basal area growth models
        for interior Douglas-fir, interior spruce, and lodgepole pine using data from
        16 plots in two blocks of a long-term study (five measurements over a 21-year
        period) on the response to pre-commercial thinning. We compared these equations
        to assess whether intraspecific or interspecific competition predominated.
        We also examined the differences in basal area growth among the three conifer
        species over time under different levels of competition. <i>Results:</i> We
        found asymmetrical relationships between the conifer trees and their neighbors
        for all species, indicating that the main driver limiting growth in these
        stands is aboveground competition for light. There was evidence of higher
        intraspecific competition for small (&lt;10.0 cm DBH) interior Douglas-fir
        in one block. However, there was no general pattern among larger subject trees
        with respect to the identity of neighborhood competitive effects and the equivalence
        of neighbors. We observed a higher level of basal area growth over time for
        interior Douglas-fir than for lodgepole pine and interior spruce, irrespective
        of the competition intensity and, not surprisingly, the growth rate declined
        with increasing competition levels for the three species. <i>Conclusions:</i>
        Our results provide an understanding of how interior Douglas-fir stands will
        develop over time and information on species interactions that could help
        forest managers explore different silvicultural options and their effects
        on individual tree growth in these complex stands.", "title": "Assessing Differences

        "abstract": "<i>Research Highlights:</i> The invasive species <i>Pinus contorta</i>,
        has become a new component of the vegetation in the Patagonian Steppe, invading
        the complex matrix of bare ground, tussock grasses and cushion plants. At
        a microsite scale, the type of native vegetation is one of the multiple factors
        determining the establishment of <i>P. contorta</i> and in some cases, increasing
        its survival, and as a result, the invasion of the species. <i>Background
        and Objectives:</i> The presence of trees, particularly pines, where they
        are naturally absent, represents a clear threat to Patagonian steppe ecosystems.
        Thus, understanding the interaction between pines and native plant species
        may be the key to understanding the invasion and applying management actions.
        <i>Pinus contorta</i> is considered one of the most aggressive among the pines
        species, with recognized impacts on regions in the southern hemisphere and
        Europe, and it is one of the main invaders in the Patagonian steppe. Our aim
        in this study is to determine the influence of surrounding vegetation on <i>P.
        contorta</i> spatial distribution, its establishment and future development
        in the Chilean Patagonia. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> We used point pattern
        analysis to determine the existence of spatial associations between <i>P.
        contorta</i> and the resident vegetation of the Patagonian steppe. Further,
        a seeding experiment was carried out to assess the influence of the surrounding
        vegetation during <i>P. contorta</i> establishment and first growing season.
        <i>Results:</i> We found that young <i>P. contorta</i> individuals are positively
        associated with the native cushion plant <i>B. magellanica</i> and also to
        tussock grasses. Seeding experiments showed that <i>P. contorta</i> is influenced
        by resident plant species during establishment and is able to establish on
        any ground cover type in the Patagonian steppe, but some resident plant species
        increase <i>P. contorta</i> survival chances. <i>Conclusions: Pinus contorta</i>
        is interacting with native vegetation and becoming an active component of
        the Patagonian steppe mosaic. Although pines can establish in any type of
        vegetation in the Patagonian steppe mosaics, native cushion and tussock grasses
        may be facilitating the process and promoting pine survival, allowing it to

        "abstract": "Periodic mountain pine beetle outbreaks have killed millions
        of hectares of lodgepole pine forests in western North America. Within these
        forests some pine trees often remain alive. It has been rarely documented
        whether anatomical defenses differ between beetle-killed and remaining live
        pine trees, especially at the northern latitudinal range of beetles in North
        America. In this study, we compared the resin duct-based anatomical defenses
        and radial growth between beetle-killed and live residual lodgepole pine trees,
        and we characterized the resin ducts and the growth of the residual trees
        before and after outbreak. We found that tree radial growth was not associated
        with tree survival. The best two predictors of tree survival were resin duct
        size and production (number per year). Trees having larger but fewer resin
        ducts showed higher survival probability compared to those with smaller but
        more abundant resin ducts annually. Residual trees had larger resin ducts
        prior to the outbreak and continued having so after the outbreak. We further
        categorized residual trees as healthy (having no signs or symptoms of insect
        or pathogen attacks), declining (with signs or symptoms of biotic attacks),
        and survived (from mountain pine beetle attacks during the outbreak) to investigate
        resin duct-based anatomical defenses among them. Healthy trees had consistently
        larger resin ducts than declining trees in the past 20 years in post-outbreak
        stands. Survival trees ranked between healthy and declining trees. Overall,
        these results demonstrate that resin duct size of lodgepole pine trees can
        be an important component of tree defenses against mountain pine beetle attacks
        and suggest that lodgepole pine trees with large resin ducts are likely to
        show resistance to future bark beetle attacks.", "title": "Larger Resin Ducts

        of tree species mortality and growth metrics following fires are important
        to assess fire impacts on forest succession, and ultimately forest growth

        a &#8216;toxicological dose-response&#8217; relationship between fire behavior
        and the resultant mortality or recovery of the trees. Prior studies have not
        been conclusive due to potential pseudo-replication in the experimental design
        and time-limited observations. We explored whether dose-response relationships
        are observed in ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>) saplings exposed to
        surface fires of increasing fire behavior (as quantified by Fire Radiative
        Energy&#8212;FRE). We confirmed equivalent dose-response relationships to
        the prior studies that were focused on other conifer species. The post-fire
        growth in the saplings that survived the fires decreased with increasing FRE
        dosages, while the percentage mortality in the sapling dosage groups increased
        with the amount of FRE applied. Furthermore, as with lodgepole pine (<i>Pinus
        contorta</i>), a low FRE dosage could be applied that did not yield mortality
        in any of the replicates (r = 10). These results suggest that land management
        agencies could use planned burns to reduce fire hazard while still maintaining
        a crop of young saplings. Incorporation of these results into earth-system

        "Ectomycorrhizal fungi (plant symbionts) are diverse and exist within spatially
        variable communities that play fundamental roles in the functioning of terrestrial
        ecosystems. However, the underlying ecological mechanisms that maintain and
        regulate the spatial structuring of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities are
        both complex and remain poorly understood. Here, we use a gradient of mountain
        pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) induced tree mortality across eleven
        stands in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests of western Canada to investigate:
        (i) the degree to which spatial structure varies within this fungal group,
        and (ii) how these patterns may be driven by the relative importance of tree
        mortality from changes in understory plant diversity, productivity and fine
        root biomass following tree death. We found that the homogeneity of the ectomycorrhizal
        fungal community increased with increasing tree death, aboveground understory
        productivity and diversity. Whereas, the independent effect of fine root biomass,
        which declined along the same gradient of tree mortality, increased the heterogeneity
        of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community. Together, our results demonstrate
        that large-scale biotic disturbance homogenizes the spatial patterns of ectomycorrhizal
        fungal communities.", "title": "Large-scale insect outbreak homogenizes the

        "abstract": "Abstract Recent regional mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks
        have generated unprecedented tree mortality across the fire\u2010prone landscapes
        of western North American forests and could potentially modify fire severity
        and postfire ecological effects. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, three fires burned
        through high mortality, gray\u2010phase lodgepole pine\u2010dominated forests
        in the plateau regions of central interior British Columbia, Canada, providing
        an opportunity to test for interactions between MPB outbreaks and wildfires.
        We inventoried 63 plots that spanned gradients of outbreak severity, fire
        severity, and burning conditions in a wilderness setting. Our objective was
        to evaluate the influence of outbreak severity on fire severity by assessing
        typical first\u2010order fire effects as well as legacy structure related
        to the consumption of woody biomass on snags/trees. We found no evidence of
        a relationship between outbreak severity and fire severity for six of seven
        first\u2010order fire effects, with the exception of deep charring. We found
        evidence that legacy structure in the form of consumed branch structure and
        deep char development had greater odds of occurrence on MPB\u2010killed snags
        compared to trees killed during wildfire. Our results indicate two key findings.
        First, fire severity as it relates to most first\u2010order fire effects measures
        is not influenced by outbreak severity, instead it is more strongly influenced
        by the interaction of fuels, weather, and topography during fire events. Second,
        our results highlight how the interaction between outbreak severity and fire
        severity alters postfire structural legacies and their functional attributes,
        which could have important ecosystem implications.", "title": "Dead forests

        "abstract": "Pinus contorta-dominated montane forests of western Canada with
        relatively dense tree canopies have ground layers with abundant bryophytes,
        especially the feather mosses (Pleurozium schreberi and Hylocomium splendens),
        while those with more open canopies are dominated by species of reindeer lichens,
        especially Cladonia arbuscula s.l. and C. rangiferina s.l. Woodland caribou
        (Rangifer tarandus caribou), which are a threatened species in Alberta, prefer
        open, Cladonia-dominated forests for their winter food supply. This study
        investigated if opening the canopy by thinning mature montane forests of the
        Canadian Rocky Mountain foothills would change the abundance of lichens and
        bryophytes. In 1997, forests were thinned by removing 20%, 40%, and 60% by
        volume. In 2016, 19 years after treatment, we re-surveyed a subset of these
        plots (n = 97) for lichen and bryophyte abundance and species richness by
        utilizing the amount of canopy opening at the plot level as our prime gradient.
        We then used ordination to determine the relationship of control plots to
        treatment plots. In uncut forest, the control plots were highly variable,
        but were mostly dominated by feather mosses, with little or no bare ground.
        Feather moss abundance was lower in treatment plots when compared to control
        plots, while cover of bare ground was greater. Overall, 19 years after treatment,
        we found that, in treatment plots, lichen abundance remained stable or slightly
        increased, feather mosses decreased markedly, and unoccupied space was double
        that of the control plots. We conclude that the canopy opening had little
        effect on understory and ground layer diversity, but considering species abundance
        (1) bryophytes have not recovered after canopy opening, (2) populations of
        reindeer lichens increased marginally, but have not colonized areas left bare
        from bryophyte dieback, and (3), after 19 years there, remains unoccupied
        areas of bare ground in plots with a reduced canopy cover. Our study demonstrated
        that, with canopy cover reduction resulting from forest thinning operations,
        the ground layer diversity is maintained, but recovery of ground layers in
        old-growth pine-dominated forests is not promoted. Therefore, timber harvest
        that partially opens the tree canopy is unlikely to benefit caribou by augmenting
        or accelerating winter food availability and habitat suitability for caribou.",

        in four boreal tree species that differed in leaf phenology (evergreen vs.
        winter-deciduous) and wood anatomy (angiosperms vs. gymnosperms). We sampled
        branch cuttings of balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera), trembling aspen (Populus
        tremuloides), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and Siberian larch (Larix siberica)
        in bi-weekly intervals from the beginning to the end of the growing season.
        Cross sections were stained with astra blue and safranin in order to assess
        the width of the current year''s phloem and to distinguish between the current
        year''s mature and enlarging/wall-thickening xylem. After enzymatic clearance
        of cytoplasmic components, we used scanning electron microscopy to observe
        seasonal patterns of callose deposition in sieve plates of balsam poplar.
        The sieve plate pores were not blocked by callose in April (prior to the start
        of the growing season) and in July. In October, after the end of the growing
        season, we found only minor callose accumulation, and only in a subset of
        samples. In three of the four species studied here, phloem formation in spring
        began before the start of xylogenesis, but the lag was shorter than what was
        previously reported for temperate environments with longer growing seasons.
        New xylem cells were first produced in trembling aspen, followed by lodgepole
        pine, balsam poplar and Siberian larch. Most of the xylem was produced in
        June and July, and all cells were mature in early September. Phloem production

        during the Last Glacial Interval (LGI: Marine Isotope Stage 2). Ice began
        to recede from western Alexander Archipelago \u223c17,000 \u00b1 700 yr BP.
        In this study, pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating of three sediment cores
        were used to reconstruct, for the first time, the postglacial development
        of vegetation in the northwestern Alexander Archipelago during the past \u223c15,240
        cal yr. Hummingbird Lake (HL), on southwestern Baranof Island, yielded a sediment
        core with one of the longest dated records from southeastern Alaska. The earliest
        part of the HL pollen record (\u223c15,240\u201314,040 yr BP) indicates that
        the earliest vegetation was pine (Pinus contorta subsp. contorta) parkland
        with willows (Salix), heaths (Ericaceae), sedges (Cyperaceae), grasses (Poaceae),
        herbs and ferns. Starting at \u223c14,040 yr BP, alder (Alnus) rapidly colonized
        the area as pine populations declined. By 11,400 yr BP, Sitka spruce (Picea
        sitchensis) colonized the area, and soon became the dominant conifer. Mountain
        hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) also colonized the area by \u223c11,400 yr BP,
        followed by western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) at \u223c10,200 yr BP. By
        \u223c9200 yr BP, western hemlock had become the dominant tree species in
        the area. During the late Holocene yellow cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis)
        became established. Two marine sediment cores were also analyzed for pollen,
        with the oldest core from Lower Sitka Sound, between Kruzof and Baranof Islands.
        The lower part of the core consists of interlayered tephras and freshwater
        lake muds that are estimated to be \u223c14,000 to 13,150 yr BP. Pollen evidence
        indicates that the early postglacial vegetation around Sitka Sound was pine
        parkland with alders and abundant ferns. Damage to vegetation around Sitka
        Sound by volcanic eruptions is suggested by abrupt, large shifts in percentages
        of alder and pine pollen, and fern spores in samples adjacent to tephra layers.
        A marine sediment core from Slocum Arm, a fiord on the western coast of Chichagof
        Island, has a basal age of \u223c10,000 yr BP. The pollen record is similar
        to the Holocene pollen record at Hummingbird Lake. The sequence of vegetation
        changes interpreted from the three northwestern Alexander Archipelago pollen

        of very high-resolution visible/near infrared hyperspectral images of young
        <i>Pinus contorta</i> trees was recorded to study the effects of herbicides
        on this invasive species. The camera was fixed on a frame while the potted
        trees were moved underneath on a conveyor belt. To account for changing illumination
        conditions, a white reference bar was included at the edge of each image line.
        Conventional preprocessing of the images, i.e., dividing measured values by
        values from the white reference bar in the same image line, failed and resulted
        in bad quality spectra with oscillation patterns that are most likely due
        to wavelength shifts across the sensor&#8217;s field of view (smile effect).
        An additional hyperspectral data set of a Spectralon white reference panel
        could be used to characterize and correct the oscillations introduced by the
        division, resulting in a high quality spectra that document the effects of
        herbicides on the reflectance characteristics of coniferous trees. While the
        spectra of untreated trees remained constant over time, there were clear temporal
        changes in the spectra of trees treated with both herbicides. One herbicide
        worked within days, the other one within weeks. Ground-based imaging spectroscopy
        with meaningful preprocessing proved to be an appropriate tool for monitoring
        the effects of herbicides on potted plants.", "title": "Preprocessing Ground-Based

        "This paper presents a scaling approach for estimating sapwood area at the
        stand level using knowledge obtained for individual trees of five boreal species:
        <i>Populus tremuloides</i> (Michx.), <i>Pinus contorta</i> (Doug. ex Loud.
        var. <i>latifolia</i> Engelm.), <i>Pinus banksiana</i> (Lamb.), <i>Picea mariana</i>

        models for sapwood depth and diameter at breast height for individual tree
        species were used to build stand level sapwood area estimates as well as stand
        level leaf area estimates, in pure and mixed vascular vegetation stands. A
        stand&#8217;s vegetation heterogeneity is considered in the scaling approach
        by proposing regression models for each species. The new combined scaling
        approach drew strong linear correlations at the stand scale between sapwood
        area and leaf area using observations taken in mixed stands of Southern Alberta,
        Canada. This last outcome suggests a good linear relationship between stand
        sapwood area and stand leaf area. The accuracy of the results was tested by
        observing each regression model&#8217;s adequacy and by estimating the error
        propagated through the whole scaling process.", "title": "Scaling Approach

        "abstract": "Abstract Background Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and interior
        spruce (Picea glauca, Picea engelmannii, and their hybrids) are distantly
        related conifer species. Previous studies identified 47 genes containing variants
        associated with environmental variables in both species, providing evidence
        of convergent local adaptation. However, if the intensity of purifying selection
        varies with the environment, clines in nucleotide diversity could evolve through
        linked (background) selection that would yield allele frequency-environment
        signatures resembling local adaptation. If similar geographic patterns in
        the strength of purifying selection occur in these species, this could result
        in the convergent signatures of local adaptation, especially if the landscape
        of recombination is conserved. In the present study, we investigated whether
        spatially/environmentally varying purifying selection could give rise to the
        convergent signatures of local adaptation that had previously reported. Results
        We analyzed 86 lodgepole pine and 50 interior spruce natural populations spanning
        heterogeneous environments in western Canada where previous analyses had found
        signatures of convergent local adaptation. We estimated nucleotide diversity
        and Tajima\u2019s D for each gene within each population and calculated the
        strength of correlations between nucleotide diversity and environmental variables.
        Overall, these estimates in the genes with previously identified convergent
        local adaptation signatures had no similar pattern between pine and spruce.
        Clines in nucleotide diversity along environmental variables were found for
        interior spruce, but not for lodgepole pine. In spruce, genes with convergent
        adaption signatures showed a higher strength of correlations than genes without
        convergent adaption signatures, but there was no such disparity in pine, which
        suggests the pattern in spruce may have arisen due to a combination of selection
        and hybridization. Conclusions The results rule out purifying/background selection
        as a driver of convergent local adaption signatures in lodgepole pine and
        interior spruce.", "title": "Purifying selection does not drive signatures

        "abstract": "Research Highlights: The biology of mountain pine beetle (MPB),
        Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, in Colorado&rsquo;s lodgepole pine forests
        exhibits similarities and differences to other parts of its range. Brood emergence
        was not influenced by stand density nor related to tree diameter. The probability
        of individual tree attack is influenced by stocking and tree size. Findings
        have implications for understanding MPB as a disturbance agent and for developing
        management strategies. Background and Objectives: MPB causes extensive tree
        mortality of lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon, across the
        western US and Canada and is probably the most studied bark beetle in North
        America. However, most of the current knowledge on the biology and ecology
        of MPB in lodgepole pine comes from the Intermountain Region of the US and
        western Canada. Little information is available from Colorado. This is the
        first study addressing effects of stand stocking levels on the biology of
        MPB and quantifying phloem consumption. In addition, although data are available
        on the conditions that foster stand infestation, this is the first study estimating
        the probability of individual tree attack among stands of known different
        stocking. Materials and Methods: Studies were conducted in managed lodgepole
        pine stands in Colorado. Unbaited traps were used to monitor MPB flight across
        stands of different densities. Cages were used to monitor emergence and bark
        samples to determine attack densities, and phloem consumption in trees growing
        under different stocking. Beetle collections were used to determine emergence
        across the growing season. Tree mortality data from plots of different densities
        were used to examine the probability of individual tree infestation. Results:
        More beetles were caught flying through higher density stands. More attacks
        were observed in lower stocking stands but there were no differences in the
        number of insects emerging nor phloem consumption. There was no relationship
        between tree size and beetle emergence. Peak flight occurred in early to mid-August
        and only one peak of beetle emergence occurred. The probability of tree attack
        was influenced by stand stocking and tree diameter. Conclusions: In general,
        aspects of the biology of MPB in Colorado exhibit similarities and differences
        with other regions. The data suggest the need to more closely examine how
        MPB functions in stands of different stocking and how the distribution of
        tree sizes influence the probability of infestation and extent of mortality
        in stands. Biological characteristics of MPB in Colorado need further examination,
        particularly as climate change continues to manifest. Baseline information
        will be critical to refine management approaches, and extend the understanding
        of how MPB contributes to shape forest composition and structure in Colorado.",
